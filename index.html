            <p>I have been in the service industry for 16 years. I started as a host out of highschool, became a waiter, bartender and later even becoming the general manager of a bar here in Austin, TX. After many years, while I still love the service industry, I don't believe that I can physically do this for the rest of my life, and so I've decided to learn to code.</p>
